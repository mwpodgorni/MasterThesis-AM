Neural Networks

What Is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a computational system made up of layers of connected nodes. These nodes transform input data, adjust internal parameters, and improve performance through training. When exposed to sufficient data, a neural network can detect patterns, make decisions, and enhance its accuracy over time.

Network Architecture

A typical neural network consists of three main layers:

Input Layer: The entry point of the network, where raw features are introduced. Each node in this layer corresponds to a specific feature, such as weight, durability, or material type. This layer does not perform computations but forwards the data to the next layer.

Hidden Layers: These layers sit between the input and output and are responsible for the network's internal processing. Nodes in hidden layers apply weights and activation functions to their inputs. Multiple hidden layers allow the network to capture increasingly abstract features, though excessive depth may lead to overfitting.

Output Layer: This layer produces the network's predictions. Each node typically represents a class, and the node with the highest activation indicates the predicted output. This layer often uses functions like softmax to generate probability distributions.

Training Neural Networks

Training a neural network involves adjusting its weights based on input data and expected outputs. Two critical parameters in this process are:

Training Cycles: Each cycle processes one data sample and updates the network. More cycles can improve performance but also risk overfitting if excessive.

Learning Rate: This parameter determines the magnitude of weight updates during training. A high learning rate may lead to instability, while a low rate can result in slow or stagnant learning.

Reinforcement Learning

Fundamental Concepts

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a method where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, shaping its behavior over time. Key components include:

State: The current configuration or observation of the environment.

Action: A possible move or decision the agent can make.

Reward: A numerical value received after taking an action in a given state.

Policy: A mapping from observed states to actions; essentially, the strategy the agent follows.

Observation and Action Spaces

Observation Space: This encompasses all the information available to the agent at each step, such as nearby tiles, obstacles, or goals. A broader observation space provides richer data but also increases the complexity of learning.

Action Space: This defines the set of all actions an agent can take, such as moving in various directions. Simpler action spaces facilitate easier learning, while complex ones enable more nuanced behavior.

Reward Adjustment

Agents are guided by rewards assigned to various environmental features. Positive rewards encourage desired actions (e.g., reaching a goal), while negative rewards discourage mistakes (e.g., entering hazardous zones). A reward of zero indicates neutral feedback.

Training Configuration Parameters

Several parameters influence the learning process:

Learning Rate: Governs how much the agent updates its knowledge based on new experiences.

Exploration Rate: Determines how often the agent experiments with new actions instead of exploiting known strategies.

Steps per Cycle: The number of actions the agent can perform during each training cycle.

Cycles: The total number of iterations the agent goes through before evaluation.

Exploration vs. Exploitation

Effective reinforcement learning requires balancing two opposing strategies:

Exploration: Trying new actions to discover their outcomes and potentially better strategies.

Exploitation: Using known information to maximize rewards based on prior learning.

An epsilon-greedy approach is commonly used, where the agent initially explores frequently and gradually shifts toward exploitation as learning progresses.

Conclusion

This overview outlines foundational concepts in neural networks and reinforcement learning. Key ideas include the architecture and training of neural networks, as well as the structure and tuning of reinforcement learning systems. Understanding these elements provides a basis for building intelligent systems that learn from data and adapt to complex environments.
