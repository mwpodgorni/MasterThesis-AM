Robot Factory – Master’s Thesis Project
Robot Factory is a short educational game built in Unity that introduces the core concepts of machine learning in an interactive and beginner-friendly way. Players can train virtual robots, adjust neural networks, and explore how machines learn—without writing any code.

This project is part of my master's thesis, which investigates whether playing an educational game is more effective for learning ML concepts than reading a traditional paper.

Research Goal
The aim is to compare two formats of learning:

A playable, interactive game

A text-based paper with the same content

Builds
Two builds are available:

RobotFactory-Game.zip: Playable version of the game

RobotFactory-Paper.zip: Version with a PDF paper instead of gameplay

Play and Participate
You can download both builds and participate in the study here:

Your feedback will directly support the research!
